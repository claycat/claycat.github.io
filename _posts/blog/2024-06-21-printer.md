I have been going through some issues with my samsung printer SL-J1785W

Every time I print something, it would print an extra page, with only one line,

`GET /devmgmt/productstatusdyn.xml http/1.1`

What a waste of paper.

I came across some articles and blog posts to fix this problem, and suspected that the driver was the issue.

Here's what I did to fix my printer

I am currently on Windows 10.

First, you need to find the most compatible driver with your printer.

For me, it was Samsung SCX-1360 series.

So I downloaded the driver from the manufacturer's [website](https://www.samsung.com/sec/support/model/SCX-1360/)

After installing the driver, I went to the windows setting for printers and scanners and select your printer

Go to advanced settings and change your driver into the compatible one.
